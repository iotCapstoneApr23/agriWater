Explanation and Directions for Implementation:
HTML Structure:

The HTML structure includes various sections to display sensor data, weather data, sprinkler data, and a map of sprinklers and sensors.
Each section is wrapped in a div with the class data-section to apply consistent styling.
CSS Styling:

General Styling: The body is styled to use the Arial font family.
Dashboard Layout: The dashboard class centers the content and arranges it in a column layout.
Data Sections: Each data-section has a defined width and margin for spacing.
Map Container: The map-container class uses a grid layout to arrange sprinklers and sensors.
Sprinkler Container: The sprinkler-container positions the sprinkler and sensors relatively.
Sprinkler Animation: The sprinkler class sets the size and applies a rotating animation for sprinklers that are "on".
Sensor Positioning: The sensor class styles sensors and positions them at the four corners of the sprinkler-container.
Sprinkler Status: The .off class disables animation and reduces opacity for sprinklers that are "off".
JavaScript:

Fetch Data: The fetchData function fetches data from the /data endpoint and parses the JSON response.
Update Content: The fetched data is used to update the content of various sections (sensor-data, weather-data, sprinkler-data, and lat-long-data).
Map Sprinklers and Sensors: The relationship between sprinklers and sensors is defined in sprinklerSensorMap.
Generate Map HTML: The map of sprinklers and sensors is generated dynamically based on the fetched data and updated in the map-container.
Sprinkler Status: The status of each sprinkler is used to determine whether to apply the .off class, which affects the animation and opacity.
Sprinkler Images:

Ensure you have an image for the sprinklers (sprinkler.png) stored in the static/images directory.
This image will be animated (rotating) if the sprinkler is "on" and static with reduced opacity if the sprinkler is "off".
By following these detailed comments and implementation instructions, your team should be able to understand and extend the functionality of this dashboard.
