# Prerequisites
Bring up prerequisites before a user installs the project. If a CLI or binary is required, provide a link to the download page.
# Install
Describe the steps to install your project. If your project can be installed with a package manager, add a code block with the install command. If your project has additional build steps, cover them and explain edge cases for specific platforms or operating systems.
# Usage
Explain how to run the project. This is a good place to describe what each script, class, function, or option does. Additional examples may be beneficial.
# Release
Provide instructions on how to release, publish, and deploy the project. Note whether the process is manual or automated and how versioning works.
# Security
Provide instructions on how to contact the project maintainer if a security vulnerability is found. This is important because if your project is open sourced, creating an issue will bring awareness to the bug, which puts more pressure on getting a fix out. See adding a security policy to your repository.
# License
Itâ€™s good practice to state the project license in the README.
# Addendum
CONTRIBUTING.md helps users understand how to contribute and make changes to your project (see template).
[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md] helps users understand how to conduct interactions with the project (see GitHub Docs).
